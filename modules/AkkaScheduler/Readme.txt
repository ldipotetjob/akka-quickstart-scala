Could be a good idea if we are working in Multi-module project and if those project
can be work in an independent way or altogether that each one has its own build.sbt.
Then a common build sbt in case that you want to compile or execute task that involve
all projects and sub-projects can be created too.

- An easy way for add external libraries is adding its to a lib folder in my module
